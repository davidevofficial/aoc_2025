My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025 "Aoc2025") in rust.

The total runtime is about 1 second on my machine (including parsing) and most solutions are not perfect and not written in "idiomatic" rust.

The problems were not particularly difficult except for day 10 part 2 (I had to use an external crate to resolve the incomplete linear systems with up to 10 unknown variables, but I am planning to create a rust solution to resolve the problem without external crates because the good_lp crate I use requires a lot of time, memory and space to compile)
